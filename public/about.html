<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! I'm a 27-year-old aspiring architect originally from Rosario, Argentina, with a penchant for adventure and a passion for creativity. My journey began in the field of Architecture, but at the tender age of 4, I made a pivotal decision to leap into the unknown and set my sights on Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>For the past 5 years, Barcelona has been my haven, where I've woven the threads of a beautiful life alongside my partner, Ciro, and our beloved furry companion, Vicki. While immersing myself in the vibrant culture of this stunning city, I've found fulfillment in the hospitality industry, yet an unyielding desire for innovation and exploration continues to propel me forward.</p>
  
<p>After much contemplation, I've embraced a new pathâ€”I've decided to become a web developer. In this digital age, I've recognized the power of technology to bring my designs and ideas to life in ways I never imagined possible. By mastering web development, I aim to seamlessly merge my passion for architecture with the limitless possibilities of the digital realm.</p>
  
<p>My story is one of embracing change, seeking new horizons, and embracing the beauty of the unexpected. I invite you to join me on this journey as I pursue my passion for architecture and design with unwavering determination and boundless creativity, now amplified by the tools of the digital world.</p>
  
<p>Let's create something extraordinary together.</p>
